Return Type: String

Run Context: System

Usage:  

​	Update the following lines:

​				`$key_name = "drive-type"` - Which type of drive to set the cipher value for:

​							Values:

​								OS Drive - EncryptionMethodWithXtsOs
​								Fixed Drives - EncryptionMethodWithXtsFdv
​								Removable Drives - EncryptionMethodWithXtsRdv

​								Example:  $key_name = "EncryptionMethodWithXtsRdv"

​				  `$ciphervalue = "cipher-value"`

​							Values:

​									AES-CBC 128-bit = 3
​									AES-CBC 256-bit = 4
​									XTS-AES 128-bit (default) - 6
​									XTS-AES 256-bit - 7

​									Example:  $cipher = "7"
